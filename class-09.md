# Reading Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?
“Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia"

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
The code is easier to test.
Immutable

4. What is immutability?
“When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.”

5. What is Referential transparency?
Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

1. What is a module?
A module is a file of JavaScript code. Separate modules of code usually make up and help distinguish different parts of a JavaScript Project.

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
Require is used to import the constructs using the module.exports

3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
Require or import.

4. What do we have to do to make a module available?

You have to use require or import to connect the modules to either each other or to the parent file.
