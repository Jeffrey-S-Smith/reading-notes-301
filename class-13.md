1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?
PUT

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
REST is an architectural system centered around resources and Hypermedia using HTTP commands. CRUD is a cycle meant to maintain records in a database setting. In its base form, CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. REST is controlling data through HTTP commands.

2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
  
* Start with your goals and intended users
* Design the API architecture
* Develop your API
* Test your API
* Monitor your API and iterate on feedback

## Things I want to know more about
  
  This section is about SQL CRUD and the basic of it. It is also about REST. It also is about what the relationships that CRUD and Rest have.
